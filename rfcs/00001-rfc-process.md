## Overview

This is the first Request for Comment (abbr. RFC) for this project.
It establishes the practice of using RFCs for proposing, discussing, implementing and documenting decisions for **pluto**.

## Goals and Non-Goals:

The goal of RFCs is to streamline the proposal, discussion, implementation and documentation of decisions for the project.

## Background & Motivation:

Currently the project does not have any formal way of proposing, discussing, implementing and documenting decisions.

Thus using RFCs is a good way to do exactly that.

## Design:

The concept is simple in its core:
- Any new decisions are proposed by creating a new RFC document (in the `rfcs` folder in the repository) by copying `_template.md`, filling it out and opening a pull request;
- After the proposal is open as pull request, contributors review it and add comments;
- After all comments are resolved, the pull request is merged and the proposal is considered accepted.
