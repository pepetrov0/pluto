## Overview

The introduction of the RFC (Request for Comments) process aims to establish a
structured framework for proposing, discussing, and implementing changes within 
the project. This process is designed to foster transparency, 
collaboration, and accountability in decision-making.

## Goals and Non-Goals:

### Goals:

- Establish a formalized process for proposing and evaluating changes.
- Encourage open communication and feedback among team members.
- Streamline decision-making and improve project management.

### Non-Goals:

- Dictate specific technical solutions.
- Address individual performance issues.

## Background & Motivation:

In our dynamic work environment, it's crucial to have a clear mechanism for 
managing change. Currently, decisions often lack documentation and may not 
involve relevant stakeholders, leading to misunderstandings and inefficiencies. 
By implementing the RFC process, we aim to address these issues and create 
a more transparent and inclusive culture of decision-making.

## Design:

The RFC process will involve the following key steps:

- **Proposal:** Any team member can submit an RFC document outlining a proposed change. This document should include background information, motivation, proposed design, potential impacts, and any dependencies.
- **Review:** The RFC will undergo review by relevant stakeholders, who will provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. Discussions may take place through designated channels such as pull requests, issues anddiscussions.
- **Approval:** After considering feedback and making necessary revisions, the RFC author will seek approval from designated approvers. Approval criteria may include alignment with project goals, feasibility, and potential impact.
- **Implementation:** Once approved, the proposed change can proceed to implementation. The RFC document will serve as a reference for the implementation team, providing guidance on the intended design and rationale behind the change.

## Dependencies:

The success of the RFC process depends on:

- Active participation and engagement from all team members.
- Availability of appropriate communication channels for discussion and review.
- Support from leadership in enforcing the use of the RFC process and allocating resources for implementation.

## Alternatives Considered/Prior Art:

Alternative approaches considered include:

- Ad-hoc decision-making: While quick and flexible, this approach lacks transparency and may lead to inconsistencies.
- Formal change management frameworks: While comprehensive, these frameworks may be overly bureaucratic and slow-moving for our needs.

The RFC process draws inspiration from similar processes used in open-source communities and large-scale software development projects, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC system.

## Risks:

Potential risks associated with the RFC process include:

- Resistance to change: Some team members may be reluctant to adopt a new decision-making process.
- Overwhelming feedback: Managing feedback from multiple stakeholders may be challenging and time-consuming.
- Ineffective implementation: Without clear guidelines and enforcement, the RFC process may fail to achieve its intended objectives.
